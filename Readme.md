# QuickSearch

original version: [profon.wordpress.com](http://profon.wordpress.com/quicksearch/)

QuickSearch is a search plugin for KeePass Password Safe v2 [KeePass.info](http://www.KeePass.info) . It can be used
as a replacement for the built-in QuickFind toolbar control.

## Development

To start developing the pluging, you should place KeePass sources at directory at one level with project. For instance, you have following structure __p:\projects\QuickSearch__, KeePass must be placed in __projects__ folder.

For KeePass source you can use this github mirror [dlech/KeePass2.x](https://github.com/dlech/KeePass2.x)
Before starting debugging you have to enable dll signing for KeePass, otherwise you will get some errors.

## Installation

Place __QuickSearch.plgx__ in your KeePass Plugins folder.


## Uninstallation

Delete __QuickSearch.plgx__ from your KeePass Plugins folder.
